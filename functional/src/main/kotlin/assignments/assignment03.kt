// Exercise: decide which scope function seems appropriate for each scenario:
// 1) if the `user` object is not null, you want to log them in
// 2) you want to create a Button object and initialize its font, color, and size
// 3) you have a StringBuilder with which you want to build a string in several steps
// 4) you want to immediately run a lambda or create a scope on-demand
// 5) you're using a closeable HTTP connection and want to avoid leaks from forgetting to call connection.close()
