// Exercise: use higher-order function from the stdlib to create the following lists based on `original` (3-5 min):
// 1) a list of only the non-negative numbers
// 2) a list where every even number is replaced by zero
// 3) a list where all negative numbers are turned positive
// 4) also compute the sum of all elements in `original` in one line
// Insert code here...
