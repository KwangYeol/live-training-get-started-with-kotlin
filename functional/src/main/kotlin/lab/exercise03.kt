// Exercise 1: implement the following infinite lazy sequences:
// 1) the sequence of all multiples of 5 (starting at zero)
// 2) the sequence 1, 1/2, 2, 1/3, 3, 1/4, 4, 1/5, 5, ...
// 3) the sequence of lists of 0 where each element has one more 0 than its predecessor (starting at zero elements)
// Insert code here...

// Exercise 2: quick-check your sequences by selecting and printing the following:
// 1) the first 10 elements from your first sequence
// 2) the first 5 elements and elements 16 to 20 from your second sequence
// 3) the first element and elements 4 to 6 from your third sequence
// Insert code here...
