// Exercise: create a class Student with the following members:
// 1) a name with a custom getter returning "Hey, my name's <NAME>" and a custom setter that rejects names without a space (should be a full name)
// 2) a lazy property `homework` (let's just make it a String) that performs heavy crunching (Thread.sleep is okay) to generate a result, but only if necessary!
// 3) an observable property outfit (again, simply a String for now) that logs when changes are made
// 3a) this should have a custom getter that returns "Wearing $outfit"
// 4) methods to dressNormally(), dressFormally(), and dressAwfully() that change the outfit to an appropriate value

// Exercise: quick-check your implementation in a simple main() function
