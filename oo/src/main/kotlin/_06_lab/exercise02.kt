// Exercise: implement each of these using appropriate types of classes for each scenario: (5 min)
// 1) the NetworkStatus class should be able to represent the states 4G, H, 3G, E, 2G.
// 1a) BONUS: add a property maxDownloadInKbit which represents the fastest (theoretical) download speed of a technology.
// 2) the Song class should store song title, band, year, and length in seconds
// 3) the Result class should represent either Success or Failure, no other options. Success carries an Int value (generics later) and Failure carries an exception.
